# Neovim as IDE
Neovim: Where the coding elite congregates, leaving "modern" IDEs in their feeble attempts to catch up. It's my go-to remedy for those IDEs that make you question if you're coding or waiting for a spaceship launch. Behold the surge of power as I orchestrate Neovim wizardry, while "modern" IDE users are still making coffee. But come on, who are we fooling? (Or maybe not fooling at all.) I'm simply head over heels for this text-editor sorcery and modern IDEs. Well, they can keep hitting that snooze button! ðŸ˜ˆ

# Setup
Change the directory the following:
```bash
cd ~/.config/nvim/
```
This is where our current setup lies inside the file `init.lua`
